# kitty !

kitty is a program that can download a video from https://www.manototv.com

but it's hard to use, because this program need something more todo.

i use this to download what is want, if you want to use this pleas read the source code.

```bash
./kitty.py 'link'
```

**consider** that link's are not from the manaototv.com!! you should finde link of a video in the
*devtool* of browser and in *network* tab !!
than with that link, you can pase the link affter the `kitty.py`

### why this way?
**sorry**, manoto site use js to call the video from it source, i dont know js and i couldn't understand
how call that source, so i found the source of video my self :\
and you shuld to
